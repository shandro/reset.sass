# Reset.sass

Reset.sass is a port of [Eric Meyer's Reset CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to [indented Sass syntax](http://sass-lang.com/).

## What is a reset.css?

Reset.css is a chunk of CSS code which defines baseline styles for most common HTML elements.

## Why use a CSS Reset?

Different browsers use varied default style settings, and these differences can screw up your layout.
Reset stylesheet reduces browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.

## How to use it

* No other styles should come before reset.css.
* It is recommended that you include the entire file as untouched library code.

## The scope of this project
This project is only intended as a conversion of the original Reset.css code to Sass format.
